üó≥Ô∏è BitBallot: Scalability and Shadow Defense
A 4x Dummy Tx Protocol on Kaspa L2 for Scalability and Shadow Defense in E-Voting

üåü Project Overview
BitBallot is a next-generation L2 electronic voting system built upon Kaspa's high-speed BlockDAG architecture as the L1 foundation.

The system is engineered to solve the fundamental challenges of "trustworthiness" and "privacy" in traditional electronic voting by focusing on economic deterrence against vote coercion and achieving unlimited scalability.

BitBallot is projected to reduce the per-vote cost by over 98% compared to traditional paper-based elections while establishing end-to-end verifiability.

Description

Shadow Defense (4x Dummy Tx)

For every one real vote, four dummy votes are automatically generated. This prevents voter identification via transaction tracing and diverts illicit funds from vote buyers into invalid transactions, creating a powerful economic deterrent.

Kaspa BlockDAG L1 Foundation

Leverages Kaspa's high-speed L1 for data persistence and integrity, providing a robust base to handle the immense transaction volume of large-scale elections.

Privacy and Decentralization Balance

External voter data integrity is maintained through hash anchoring to L1. L2 nodes are pruned after two months to maintain a balance between long-term decentralization and short-term accessibility.

üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture & Future Prospect
Current Protocol Design
L1: Kaspa (High-speed BlockDAG)

L2: BitBallot's custom Mini-Blockchain Protocol

Authentication: Voter authentication secured via Soulbound Token (SBT)

Ultimate Scalability with vProgs
The architecture is designed for future adoption of the vProgs (Verifiable Programs) model, as proposed for Kaspa, to achieve ultimate scalability.

Technology

Contribution

vProgs (Verifiable Programs)

A new application execution model combining off-chain computation and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-Proofs). L1 nodes only verify a small ZK-Proof, enabling infinite scalability for national election volumes.

Prover Economy

Utilizes an economy that rewards ZK-Proof generators (Provers). This establishes a sustainable revenue stream for L2 node operators, ensuring long-term system maintenance.
